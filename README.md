The integration of large language models (LLMs) as health assistants could significantly impact society by enhancing healthcare accessibility, especially in underserved areas. These models can support healthcare professionals by providing quick access to medical information, assist in preliminary diagnoses, and reduce workloads. They offer personalized health advice and mental health support, and play a role in educating the public about health issues. 

Additionally, LLMs can help in public health monitoring and response, potentially reducing healthcare costs. However, this technology faces challenges in ensuring information accuracy, maintaining privacy, and addressing ethical implications. Furthermore, LLMs can improve with continued learning and help bridge language and cultural barriers in healthcare.

Thanks to suggestions by chatGPT and support from NVIDIA was it possible to create this repository.
